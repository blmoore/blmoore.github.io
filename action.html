        I recently read Arnie's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1849839735/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1849839735&linkCode=as2&tag=blmio-21">autobiography</a>
        (great fun) and in it he writes about the various roles he's
        had, discussing those movies that flopped or were surprise box office successes,
         but it's hard to build up an overall picture of his career from these fragments.
         Similarly the raw filmography lists at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">IMDb</a>
         and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger#Filmography" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
         are pretty uninspiring.
      </p>
      <p>
        That gave me the idea of charting his movie career over time, attempting to
        show a lot of information at once about how well the film did at box office
        relative to its budget, and at what points these successes and failures
        happened over the last few decades. After some
        <a href="http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">python-powered</a>
        scraping of IMDb data, this is what I came up with:
      </p>
      <a href="svg/arnie.svg"><img src="svg/arnie.svg" width=100% /></a>
      <p>
        It's interesting to see the trajectory from back-to-back hits in low
        budget action films (Terminator, Predator, Commando) to a peak of a $200 million
        budget for Terminator 3 (considerably more in 2014 dollars, after adjusting for
        inflation). Of course you can then see his stretch as Governor of California
        from 2003-11, punctuated only by a memorable cameo in The Expendables <sup>(and an
        excluded minor role in The Kid & I)</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eagle-eyed will notice some films are missing, there's no
        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065832/" target="_blank">Hercules in New York</a>
        and others of his earliest films. This is down to IMDb's budget and gross listings
        being woefully incomplete, but thankfully most of his famous lead roles are shown.
      </p>
      <p>
        These next obvious step was to look at other actors that fill a similar
        niche; how does Sly Stallone compare? What about the more recent action
        stars?

      <h3>Budget</h3>
      <p>First, by budget. It's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?infosource" target="_blank">unclear</a>
        where IMDb gets this data from, so should be taken with a pinch of salt to some extent.</p>
      <div id='actionBudget' class='rChart dimple'></div>
      <script src="javascripts/action_budget.js"></script>

    <h3>Gross</h3>
    <p>Here's the same graph but by gross. These numbers from IMDb are even <em>more</em>
      suspect and vary according to different sources. Additionally, to convert the gross
      to 2014 dollars I used a measure of inflation since the year the film was released in &mdash; to
      calculate this more accurately you need a breakdown of the gross over time. Unlike lists at
      <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/" target="_blank">Box OFfice Mojo</a>, these charts do
      sometimes contain cameo roles (e.g. Bruce and Arnie get Expendables I credits), and sometimes
      exclude starring roles where there was no budget and gross data available (and parseable) on
      IMDb.
