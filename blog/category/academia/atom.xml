		   <p>The first paper of my PhD is finally out! Its full title is &quot;<a href="http://genomebiology.com/2015/16/1/110">Integrative modeling reveals the principles of multi-scale chromatin boundary formation in human nuclear organization</a>&quot; but in talks and posters I&#39;ve been referring to the project as &quot;Unravelling higher order chromatin organisation&quot; (geddit?) or even &quot;the ENCODE-ing of ...&quot; (referencing <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/">ENCODE</a>, of course).</p>

<p>This project was done entirely with open data, I&#39;ve made my code <a href="https://github.com/blmoore/3dgenome">open source</a> and in the interests of open science I thought I&#39;d write up a blog summary of the paper.</p>

<h2> Data</h2>

<p>The project came out of the observation (made a couple of years ago now) that Hi-C datasets were available for each of the tier 1 ENCODE human cell lines: meaning we had access to an unprecedented amount of matched chromatin data.</p>

<div style="margin: 0 auto 10px auto; width: 91%">
<img src="/blog/img/lieberman2009.png" width="30%" />
<img src="/blog/img/kalhor2011.png" width="30%" />
<img src="/blog/img/dixon2012.png" width="30%" />
</div>

<p>Though now better sources are available, when we started there were three human Hi-C papers we gathered data from : the original Hi-C paper (<a href="dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1181369">Leiberman Aiden <em>et al.</em>, 2009</a>); an improved method, TCC, with also ran Hi-C for comparison (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2057">Kalhor <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>); and a much more-deeply sequenced dataset that first reported TADs (<a href="dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11082">Dixon <em>et al.</em>, 2012</a>). These papers produced genome-wide Hi-C data for human cell types K562, Gm12878 and H1 hESC respectively, and as mentioned, these are the <a href="http://www.genome.gov/26524238">ENCODE tier 1 cell lines</a>.</p>

<p><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/encode_celllines.png" /></p>

<p>These Hi-C datasets were produced by different labs, using slightly different protocols and with varying levels of sequencing. With this in mind, directly comparing contacts is going to be tricky, even after thorough normalisation. In our analysis, we relied mostly on abstracted measures of chromatin conformation: compartment eigenvectors, TAD calls or within cell-line contacts only.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>Broadly we were interested in how chromatin features are related to genome conformation. The main questions we try to address in the manuscript boil down to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To what extent does higher order chromatin structure &mdash; by which I mostly mean megabase-sized topological domains and multi-megabase chromosome compartments &mdash; vary between cell types, and is there interesting biology where they&#39;re discordant?</p></li>
<li><p>How do chromatin features (like histone modifications, transcription factors) connect to what&#39;s going on at the level of higher-order chromatin structure? What can we learn the rules underlying this relationship?</p></li>
<li><p>How do the boundary regions demarcating higher-order domains vary between cell types?</p></li>
</ol>

<h3> 1. Genome organisation pretty similar across human cell types</h3>

<p>After re-processing each Hi-C data uniformly from raw sequencing reads (and applying <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2148">iterative correction</a>), it wasn&#39;t a huge suprise to find a broad agreement of higher-order chromatin structure between human cell types.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Along the left-hand side of figure 1 I&#39;m plotting the principal component eigenvector derived from Hi-C contact maps (reflecting A/B compartment profile, following <a href="dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1181369">Leiberman Aiden <em>et al.</em>, 2009</a>). You can see cell type profiles track one another along the chromosome, the genome-wide Pearson correlation of these values a 1 Mb resolution was around 0.80.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/f1_full.png" target="_blank"><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/f1_thumb.png" /></a></p>

<p>Similarly at the level of TADs &mdash; shaded rectangles in the zoomed region &mdash; there&#39;s a decent agreement between cell types. Despite the sub-optimal TAD-calling algorithm (the published <a href="dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11082">Dixon <em>et al.</em>, 2012</a>) and a sparse contact map given the resolution (particularly in K562), there was still around a third of boundaries in one cell type that could be very precisely mapped to boundaries in the other two.</p>

<h3>2. Chromatin features predict aspects of genome architecture</h3>

<p>In short we built <a href="http://blm.io/talks/bsa/figure/rfp.png">Random Forest regression models</a> to predict the continuous compartment profile (the blue line in the above figure), and it achieved high accuracy. This wasn&#39;t wholly surprising: strong correlations between individual input variables and compartment profile has already been reported (even in the original <a href="dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1181369">Leiberman Aiden paper</a>), so the interest really comes from dissecting and cross-applying these models, rather than from their raw metrics.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/f2_full.png" target="_blank"><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/f2_thumb.png" /></a></p>

<p>We found that models learned in one cell-type had almost as much predictive power in another cell type, suggested common rules governing higher order structure. However, we&#39;ve already seen that much of this structure is the same between cell types, so are these fixed regions inflating our accuracy measures?</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/f4_full.png" target="_blank"><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/f4_thumb.png" /></a></p>

<p>It turns out that yes, if you split your input dataset by how variable these regions are between cell types, it turns out those most variable regions are more difficult to predict (<strong>A</strong>, <em>above</em>).</p>

<p>This raises another question: are these variable regions in some way more noisy or is there something interesting going on? The right panel (<strong>B</strong>, <em>above</em>) tries to address this by doing some functional analysis. The results were that &quot;flipped&quot; open regions (e.g. a megabase active in Gm12878, but a closed, repressive compartment in the other two human cell types) showed an enrichment for predicted enhancer chromatin states,<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> potentially highlighting areas of cell-type specific gene activation. We followed this up by picking out some examples (<strong>A</strong>, <em>below</em>) and returning to Hi-C contacts to look for changes in long-range interactions.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/f5ex_full.png" target="_blank"><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/f5ex_thumb.png" /></a></p>

<h3>3. Domain boundaries enriched for lots of things</h3>

<p>The last part of the paper I want to mention was an analysis of domain boundary enrichments. TAD boundaries were brought to the fore by <a href="dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11082">Dixon <em>et al.</em> (2012)</a>, but there&#39;s been debate about how important or interesting these spacers are. Are boundaries <em>responsible</em> for domains (i.e. binding of insulators and other factors blocks heterochromatin expansion) or are boundaries just &quot;what&#39;s left&quot; when an active domain is adjacent to, say, a repressive lamina-associated domain?</p>

<p>While we couldn&#39;t resolve that debate in this paper, we were still interested in comparing TAD boundaries across cell types, as well as looking at compartment boundaries too. We also statistically tested the enrichment of each feature, rather than just showing the &quot;average-o-gram&quot; profiles.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/f6_full.png" target="_blank"><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/f6_thumb.png" /></a></p>

<p>The results recap some of the known TAD enrichments (CTCF, Pol2) but also find an overlapping range of peaked features at compartment boundaries, and at a broader scale.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Overall we found higher order chromatin structure is well-conserved between human cell types and well-described by locus-level chromatin features, but divergent regions contain cell-type-specific biology that could be cause or consequence of these differences. Our difficulties predicting these more flexible regions could be due to missing input features from our datasets or, more likely in my view, local activation and repression mechanisms not captured by a genome-wide model.</p>

        <title>Building an academic CV in markdown</title>
        <link>http://blm.io/blog/markdown-academic-cv</link>
		<author>benjaminlmoore</author>
		<pubDate>2015-04-13T00:00:00+01:00</pubDate>
		<guid>http://blm.io/blog/markdown-academic-cv</guid>
		<description><![CDATA[
		   <p>I&#39;m creeping towards the tail-end of my PhD so it&#39;s probably time to dust off my CV and tidy it up. In the past I&#39;ve written this document a few different ways, from LaTeX to a custom <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a> document, but I&#39;ve decided to move with the times and try something new: a markdown CV that compiles to both an HTML web version and well-formatted PDF.</p>

<h2>markdown-cv</h2>

<p>Googling &quot;markdown CV&quot; gave a few different options: one using <a href="http://mszep.github.io/pandoc_resume/">pandoc</a> with slightly dated-looking themes; another <a href="http://there4development.com/blog/2012/12/31/markdown-resume-builder/">command-line PHP script</a>, whose results are a bit prettier, but after trying these I came across <code>markdown-cv</code> from github user <a href="https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv">elipapa</a> which seemed to be simple to use and came with a nice design &mdash; also it&#39;s built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, which I already <a href="http://blm.io/blog/wordpress-to-jekyll/">use to power blm.io</a>.</p>

<p>Eliseo Papa wrote up a <a href="http://www.eliseopapa.org/workflow/2012/09/20/why-i-switched-to-markdown-for-my-cv/">blog post</a> on how and why he put <code>markdown-cv</code> together, and their CV <a href="https://github.com/elipapa/elipapa.github.io/blob/master/downloads/cv.pdf">looks great</a> so that was enough to convince me to give it a shot.</p>

<h3>HTML version</h3>

<p><code>markdown-cv</code> uses CSS media queries to select different stylesheets for screen and print. This means in practice you can optimise your CV design for each medium pretty easily &mdash; I went with a kind of colourful web version and more toned-down print version.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t make any big changes to <a href="https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv">elipapa&#39;s markdown-cv</a>, just played with the colours, fonts, and tweaked the layout and added <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">font-awesome icons</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a screenshot of the current HTML version of my CV:</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/html-mdcv.png" target="_blank">
<img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/html-mdcv.png" />
</a></p>

<p>I like the whitespace and clear separation of headings, dates and details. The underlying CSS layout has some technical issues &mdash; the relative positions can get messed up on resize &mdash; but it still looks good on mobile devices and at a range of display resolutions.</p>

<h3>PDF version</h3>

<p><img class="imgright" src="/blog/img/printcv-ul.png" width="40%" /></p>

<p>There were a few difficulties converting the web version to print. The general approach for CVs in markdown seems to be to run <a href="http://wkhtmltopdf.org/">wkhtmltopdf</a>, however this uses WebKit for rendering (as the name suggests) which it turns out has issues with some modern CSS features when printing.</p>

<p>One issue was with CSS3 multiple <code>columns</code> layout, with <code>wkhtmltopdf</code> these were rendered in a single column while the web version renders correctly in 3-columns, across modern browsers.</p>

<p><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/webcv-ul.png" /></p>

<p>It turns out support was <a href="https://www.webkit.org/blog/88/css3-multi-column-support/#comment-16854">dropped</a> for printing columns specified in this way due to issues with page breaks, and apparently this still hasn&#39;t been resolved. To get around this, I convert to PDF through Firefox with its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko">Gecko engine</a> and all is well.</p>

<p><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/printcv-ulfixed.png" /></p>

<p>Page breaks can still be iffy though, web renderers are no LaTeX, so if it doesn&#39;t break cleanly over pages you can add these in manually using CSS. For example, say you want to add a page break before your publications section:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>cv.md</code></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">## Publications

You _et al._ (2014) Some great paper...
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p><code>cv-print.css</code></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nf">#publications</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">page</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">break</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">before</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">always</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There&#39;s another issue I can&#39;t debug relating to web links in the PDF version (currently some work, some don&#39;t), but in theory the PDF is for print so maybe it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<h3>Result</h3>

        <title>Author inflation in academic literature</title>
        <link>http://blm.io/blog/author-inflation</link>
		<author>benjaminlmoore</author>
		<pubDate>2014-04-06T00:00:00+01:00</pubDate>
		<guid>http://blm.io/blog/author-inflation</guid>
		<description><![CDATA[
		   <p>There seems to be a general consensus that author lists in academic articles are growing. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_authorship#Growing_number_of_authors_per_paper" target="_blank">says so</a>, and I've also come across a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.21438/abstract" target="_blank">published letter</a> and short <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/history/full/nature06243.html" target="_blank">Nature article</a> which accept this is the case and discuss ways of mitigating the issue. Recently there was an interesting discussion on <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/16759/is-there-an-inflation-in-the-number-of-authors-per-paper" target="_blank">academia.stackexchange</a> on the subject but again without much quantification. Luckily given the array of literature database APIs and language bindings available, it should be pretty easy to investigate with some statistical analysis in R.</p>

<h2>rplos</h2>

<p><a title="ropensci" href="http://ropensci.org/" target="_blank">ROpenSci</a> offers nice R language bindings for the PLOS (I'm more used to PLoS but I'll go with it) API, called <a title="rplos" href="https://github.com/ropensci/rplos" target="_blank">rplos</a>. There's no particular reason to limit the search to PLOS journals but rplos seems significantly more straightforward to work with than pubmed API packages I've used in the past like <a title="RISmed" href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RISmed/index.html" target="_blank">RISmed</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally the PLOS group contains two journals of particular interest to me:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="plos comp biol" href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/" target="_blank">PLOS Computational Biology</a> — a respectable specialist journal in my field; have bioinformatics articles been particularly susceptible to author inflation?</li>
<li><a title="PLOS ONE" href="http://www.plosone.org/" target="_blank">PLOS ONE</a> — the original mega-journal. I wonder if the huge number of articles published here show different trends in authorship over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only strange part of the search was at the PLOS API end. To search by the <code>publication_year</code> field you need to supply both a beginning and end date range, in the form:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-r" data-lang="r">publication_date<span class="o">:</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">2001-01-01</span>T00<span class="o">:</span><span class="m">00</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="m">00</span>Z TO <span class="m">2013-12-31</span>T23<span class="o">:</span><span class="m">59</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="m">59</span>Z<span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>A tad verbose, right? I can't imagine wanting to search for things published at a particular time of day. A full PLOS API query using the rplos package looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-r" data-lang="r">searchplos<span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="c1"># Query: publication date in 2012</span>
  q  <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;publication_date:[2012-01-01T00:00:00Z TO 2012-12-31T23:59:59Z]&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="c1"># Fields to return: id (doi) and author list</span>
  fl <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;id,author&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="c1"># Filter: only actual articles in journal PLOS ONE</span>
  fq <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;doc_type:full&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="s">&quot;cross_published_journal_key:PLoSONE&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span>
  <span class="c1"># 500 results (max 1000 per query)</span>
  start<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> limit<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">500</span><span class="p">,</span> sleep<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">6</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>A downside of using the PLOS API is that the set of journals are quite recent, PLOS ONE started in 2006 and PLOS Biology was only a few years before in 2003, so it'll only give us a limited window into any long-term trends.</p>

<h2>Distribution of author counts</h2>

<p>Before looking at inflation we can compare the distribution of author counts per paper between the journals:</p>

<p><a href="http://benjaminlmoore.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/beans_overall.png"><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/beans_overall.png" alt="Distribution of author counts" width="500" height="500" /></a>
<a href="http://benjaminlmoore.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/journal_ecdf.png"><img class="imgright" src="/blog/img/journal_ecdf.png" alt="ECDF per journal" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>Possibly more usefully — but less pretty — the same data be plotted as empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF). From these we can see that PLOS Biology had the highest proportion of single-author papers in my sample (n = ~22,500 articles overall) followed by PLOS Medicine, with PLOS Genetics showing more high-author papers at the long-tail of the distribution, including the paper with the most authors in the sample (<a title="couch" href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003212" target="_blank">Couch et al., 2013</a> with 270 authors).</p>

<h2>Author inflation</h2>
<p>So, in these 6 different journals published by PLOS, how has the mean number of authors per paper varied across the past 7 years?</p>
<p><a href="http://benjaminlmoore.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/alltrends.png"><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/alltrends.png" alt="PLOS author inflation" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Above I've shown yearly means plus their 95% confidence intervals, as estimated by a non-parametric bootstrap method implemented in <a title="ggplot2" href="http://ggplot2.org/" target="_blank">ggplot2</a>. Generally from this graph it does look like there's a slight upward trend on average, though arguably the mean is not the best summary statistic to use for this data, which I've shown is not normally distributed, and may better fit an extreme value distribution.</p>
<p>The relationship between publication date and number of authors per paper become clearer if it's broken down by journal:</p>

<p><a href="http://benjaminlmoore.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/plot_lm.png"><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/plot_lm.png" alt="Author inflation regression" width="500" height="352" /></a></p>

<p>Here linear regression reveals a significant positive coefficient for year against mean author count per paper, as high as .52 extra authors per year on average, down to just .06 a year for PLOS ONE. Surprisingly the mega-journal which published around 80,000 papers over this time period seems least susceptible to author inflation.</p>
<p><a href="http://benjaminlmoore.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/authinflation_bars.png"><img class="imgleft" src="/blog/img/authinflation_bars.png" alt="Author inflation per journal" width="214" height="300" /></a>The explained variance in mean number of authors per paper (per year) ranges from .28 (PLOS ONE) up to an impressive .87 for PLOS Medicine, with PLOS Computational Biology not far behind on .83. However, PLOS Computational Biology had the second lowest regression coefficient, and the lowest average number of authors of the six journals — maybe us introverted computer types should be collaborating more widely!</p>

<h2>Journal effects</h2>
<p>It's interesting to speculate on what drives the observed differences in author inflation between journals. A possible covariate is the roundly-condemned "Impact Factor" journal-level metric — are "high impact" journals seeing more author creep than lesser publications?</p>
<p><a href="http://benjaminlmoore.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/corr_authif.png"><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/corr_authif.png" alt="Correlation of author inflation and impact factor" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>If estimate of author inflation is plotted against respective journals' recent impact factors, there does indeed appear to be a positive correlation. However, this comparison only has 6 data points so there's not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between these two variables (p = 0.18).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<h4>Is author inflation occurring?</h4>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>, it certainly appears to be on average.</p>
<h4>Is it a problem?</h4>
<p>I don't know, but I'd lean towards probably not.</p>
<p>The average trends could be reflecting the proliferation of "<a title="big science" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Science" target="_blank">Big Science</a>" with huge collaborative consortiums like <a title="ENCODE" href="http://encodeproject.org/ENCODE/" target="_blank">ENCODE</a> and <a title="FANTOM" href="http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/" target="_blank">FANTOM</a> (though the main papers of those examples were targeted to <em>Nature</em>) and doesn't necessarily support a conclusion that Publish or Perish culture is forcing lots of token authorships and backhanders between scientists.</p>
<p>Maybe instead (as the <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/16759/is-there-an-inflation-in-the-number-of-authors-per-paper" target="_blank">original discussion</a> hypothesised), people that traditionally may not have been credited with authorship (bioinformaticians doing end-point analysis and lab technicians) are now getting recognised for their input more often, or conceivably advances in cloud computing, distributed data storage and video conferencing has better enabled larger collaborations between scientists across the globe!</p>
<p>Either way, evidence for author inflation is not evidence of a problem <em>per se</em> :)</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>
<ul>
<li>Means used for regression — while we get a surprisingly high R<sup>2</sup> for regression the mean number of authors per paper per year, the predictive power for individual papers unsurprisingly vanishes (R<sup>2</sup> plummets to between .02 and 4.6 × 10<sup>-4</sup> per journal — significant non-zero coefficients remain). Author inflation wouldn't be expected to exhibit consistent and pervasive effects in all papers, for example reviews, letters and opinion pieces presumably have consistently lower author counts than research articles and not all science can work in a collaborative, multi-author framework.</li>
<li>Search limits — rplos returns a maximum of 1000 results at a time (but they can be returned sequentially using the <code>start</code> and <code>limit</code> parameters). They seem to be drawn in reverse order of time so the results here probably aren't fully representative of the year in some cases. This has also meant my sample is unevenly split between journals: PLoSBiology: 2487; PLoSCompBiol: 3403; PLoSGenetics: 4013; PLoSMedicine: 2094; PLoSONE: 7176; PLoSPathogens:3647; <strong>Total:</strong> 22,460.</li>
<li>Resolution — this could be done in a more fine-grained way, say with monthly bins. As mentioned above, for high-volume journals like PLOS ONE, the sample is likely coming from the end of the years from ~2010 onwards.</li>
</ul>
