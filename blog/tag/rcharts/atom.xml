<p>
I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451662440/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1451662440&linkCode=as2&tag=blmio-20&linkId=H7MGQFNQ3X6N6UJK">Arnie's autobiography</a>
(great fun) and in it he writes about the various roles he's
had, discussing those movies that flopped or were surprise box office successes,
but it's hard to build up an overall picture of his career from these fragments.
Similarly the raw filmography lists at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">IMDb</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger#Filmography" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
are pretty uninspiring.
</p>

<p>
That gave me the idea of charting his movie career over time, attempting to
show a lot of information at once about how well the film did at box office
relative to its budget, and at what points these successes and failures
happened over the last few decades. After some
<a href="http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">python-powered</a>
scraping of IMDb data, this is what I came up with:
</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/arnie.png"><img src="/blog/img/arnie_thumb.png" width=100% /></a>
<p>
It&#39;s interesting to see the trajectory from back-to-back hits in low
budget action films (Terminator, Predator, Commando) to a peak of a $200 million
budget for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_3:_Rise_of_the_Machines" target="_blank">Terminator 3</a>
(considerably more in 2014 dollars, after adjusting for
inflation). Of course you can then see his stretch as Governor of California
from 2003-11, punctuated only by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrMmiUSVRRI" target="_blank">memorable cameo</a>
in The Expendables <sup>(and an excluded minor role in The Kid &amp; I)</sup>.
</p>
<p>
The eagle-eyed will notice some films are missing, there&#39;s no
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065832/" target="_blank">Hercules in New York</a>
and others of his earliest films. This is down to IMDb&#39;s budget and gross listings
being woefully incomplete, but thankfully most of his famous lead roles are shown.
</p>
<p>
These next obvious step was to look at other actors that fill a similar
niche; how does Sly Stallone compare? What about the more recent action
stars?

<p>
So we&#39;ve learnt that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246" target="_blank">Bruce Willis</a>
is in way too many films to label clearly, and Jackie Chan doesn&#39;t seem to mind frenetically
jumping from big-money blockbusters and low-budget action flicks.
</p>
<p>

<p style="font-size:smaller">Fancy a gamble? Pick Sly or Jackie as your lead.</p>
</figcaption>
</div></p>

<p>I can use this data to look at the mean expected return on investment (ROI)
per leading man, by just taking the mean gross over budget. This shows that
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000329/" target="_blank">Jackie Chan</a>,
albeit with a pretty huge amount of variance, has the highest expected ROI of the actors
listed here. At the other end of the scale is
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005458/" target="_blank">Jason Statham</a>, but in fairness I haven&#39;t
normalised for the budgets of the films they&#39;re starring in &mdash; if you stick to
$100 million films it&#39;s pretty much impossible to then multiple that by ten at the box office!
</p></p>

<h3>All-time totals per actor</h3>

<p>
Another (possibly fairer) way to compare these guys is by total budgets
and grosses over their careers. It's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?infosource" target="_blank">not entirely clear</a>
where IMDb gets these values from, so the absolute numbers should be taken with a pinch of salt.</p><br />
<div id='actionBudget' class="rChart"></div>
<script src="/blog/js/action_budget.js"></script>

<p>Here's the same graph but by box office takings. These numbers from IMDb are even <em>more</em>
suspect and vary according to different sources. Additionally, to convert the gross
to 2014 dollars I used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index" target="_blank">measure of inflation</a>
from the year the film was released in &mdash; to
calculate this more accurately you need a breakdown of the gross over time. Unlike lists at
<a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/" target="_blank">Box Office Mojo</a>, these charts do
sometimes contain cameo roles (e.g. Bruce and Arnie get Expendables I credits), and as I mentioned
with Arnie, there's unfortunately some missing or incomplete data on IMDb which has lead to some
films being excluded.
</p><br />
<div id='actionGross' class="rChart"></div>
<script src="/blog/js/action_gross.js"></script>

<p>
It turns out Sly has grossed more than Arnie on smaller budgets! We can also see
Jackie Chan punches well above his weight in terms of absolute earnings, as well as ROI.</p>

<p>Finally here's budget plotted against gross for most of the individual films used in this analysis.</p>

<div id='actionBudgetVGross' class="rChart"></div>

<script src="/blog/js/action_budgetVgross.js"></script>

<p>The python and R scripts to recreate all the above analysis are
<a href="https://github.com/blmoore/blogR" target="_blank">on github</a>,
and it should be pretty straightforward to extend this over any other actors
or actresses you might be interested in (like, say, Jean-Claude Van Damme whom
  I completely forgot about).

        <title>Celebrity twitter followers by gender</title>
        <link>http://blm.io/blog/twitter-genders</link>
		<author>benjaminlmoore</author>
		<pubDate>2014-05-25T00:00:00+01:00</pubDate>

		<description><![CDATA[
		   <p>The most popular accounts on twitter have millions of followers, but what are their demographics like? Twitter doesn't collect or release this kind of information, and even things like name and location are only voluntarily added to people's profiles. Unlike Google+ and Facebook, twitter has no real name policy, <a href="https://gigaom.com/2011/09/16/why-twitter-doesnt-care-what-your-real-name-is/" target="_blank">they don't care</a> what you call yourself, because they can still divine out useful information from your account activity.</p>

<p>For example, you can optionally set your location on your twitter profile. Should you choose not to, twitter can still just <a title="geolocation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation" target="_blank">geolocate</a> your IP. If you use an anonymiser or VPN, they could use the timing of your account activity to infer a timezone. This could then be refined to a city or town using the topics you tweet about and the locations of friends and services you mention most.</p>

<p>I chose to look at one small aspect of demographics: gender, and used a cheap heuristic based on stated first name to estimate the male:female ratios in a sample of followers from these very popular accounts.</p>

<h2>Top 100 twitter accounts by followers</h2>

<p>A top 100 list is made available by <a title="Twitter Counter" href="http://twittercounter.com/pages/100" target="_blank">Twitter Counter</a>. It's not clear that they have made this list available through their API, but thanks to the markup, a quick hack is to scrape the usernames using <a title="RCurl" href="http://www.omegahat.org/RCurl/" target="_blank">RCurl</a> and some <a title="Regex" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" target="_blank">regex</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span class="kn">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;RCurl&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
top.100 <span class="o">&lt;-</span> getURL<span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;http://twittercounter.com/pages/100&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># split into lines</span>

<span class="c1"># Get only those lines with an @</span>

<span class="c1"># [1] &quot;katyperry&quot;  &quot;justinbieber&quot;  &quot;BarackObama&quot;  ...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>R package twitteR</h2>

<p>Getting data from the <a title="twitter API" href="https://dev.twitter.com/" target="_blank">twitter API</a> is made simple by the twitteR package. I made use of <a title="twitteR" href="http://davetang.org/muse/2013/04/06/using-the-r_twitter-package/" target="_blank">Dave Tang's worked example</a> for the initial OAuth setup, once that's complete the twitteR package is really easy to use.</p>

<p>The difficulty getting data from the API, as ever, is to do with <a title="rate limits" href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/rate-limiting/1.1" target="_blank">rate limits</a>. Twitter allows 15 requests for follower information per 15 minute window. (Number of followers can be queried by a much more generous 180 requests per window.) This means that to get a sample of followers for each of the top 100 twitter accounts, it'll take <em>at a minimum</em> 1 hour 40 mins to stay on the right side of the rate limit. I ended up using 90 second sleep windows between requests to be safe, making a total query time of two and a half hours!</p>

<p>Another issue is possibly to do with strange characters being returned and breaking the JSON import. This error crops up a lot and meant that I had to lower the sample size of followers to avoid including these problem accounts. After some highly unscientific tests, I settled on about 1000 followers per account which seemed a good trade-off between maximising sample size but minimising failure rate.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span class="c1"># Try to sample 3000 followers for a user:</span>
username<span class="o">$</span>getFollowers<span class="p">(</span>n<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">3000</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># Error in twFromJSON(out) :</span>
<span class="c1">#  Error: Malformed response from server, was not JSON.</span>
<span class="c1"># The most likely cause of this error is Twitter returning</span>
<span class="c1"># a character which can&#39;t be properly parsed by R. Generally</span>
<span class="c1"># the only remedy is to wait long enough for the offending</span>
<span class="c1"># character to disappear from searches.</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Gender inference</h2>

<p>Here I used a relatively new R package, <a title="gender package" href="https://github.com/ropensci/gender" target="_blank">rOpenSci's gender</a> (kudos for resisting gendR and the like). This uses U.S. social security data to probabilistically link first names with genders, e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-r" data-lang="r">devtools<span class="o">::</span>install_github<span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;ropensci/gender&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="kn">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;gender&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
gender<span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;ben&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#   name proportion_male proportion_female gender</span>
<span class="c1"># 1  ben          0.9962            0.0038   male</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So chances are good that I'm male. But the package also returns proportional data based on the frequency of appearances in the SSA database. Naively these can be interpreted as the probability a given name is either male or female. So in terms of converting a list of 1000 first names to genders, there are a few options:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Threshold</strong>: if  &gt;.98 male or female, assign gender, else ignore.</li>
<li><strong>Probabilistically</strong>: use random number generation to assign each case, if a name is .95 male and .05 female, on average assign that name to females 5% of the time.</li>
<li><strong>Bayesian-ish</strong>: threshold for almost certain genders (e.g. .99+) and use this as a prior belief of gender ratios when assigning gender to the other followers for a given user. This would probably lower bias when working with heavily skewed accounts.</li>
</ol>

<p>I went with #2 here. Anecdotal evidence suggests it's reasonably accurate anyway, with twitter analytics (using bag of words, sentiment analysis and all sorts of clever tricks to unearth gender) estimating my account has 83% male followers (!), with probabilistic first name assignment estimating 79% (and that's with a smaller sample). Method #3 may correct this further but the implementation tripped me up.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p><a href="http://benjaminlmoore.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/twittergenderdist.png"><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/twittergenderdist.png" alt="Celebrity twitter followers by gender" width="500" height="833" /></a></p>

<p>So boys prefer football (soccer) and girls prefer One Direction, who knew? Interestingly Barack Obama appears to have a more male following (59%), as does Bill Gates with 67%.</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, below One Direction, Simon Cowell is a hit with predominantly female twitter users (70%), as is Kanye West (67%) and Khloe Kardashian (72%).</p>

<p>Another surprise is that Justin Bieber, famed as teen girl heartthrob, actually has a more broad gender appeal with 41 / 59 male-female split.</p>

<h2>Interactive charts</h2>

<p><a href="http://blm.io/twitter"><img class="imgright" src="/blog/img/screen-shot-2014-05-25-at-11-51-25.png" alt="Click for an interactive version." width="150" height="86" /></a></p>

<p>Using the fantastic <a title="rcharts" href="http://rcharts.io/" target="_blank">rCharts</a> library, I've put together some <a title="interactive charts" href="http://blm.io/twitter" target="_blank">interactive graphics</a> that let you explore the above results further. These use the <a title="NVD3" href="http://nvd3.org/" target="_blank">NVD3 graphing library</a>, as opposed to my <a href="http://rcharts.io/viewer/?6c9ed5eed37fe3c03fa5" target="_blank">previous effort</a> which used <a href="http://dimplejs.org/" target="_blank">dimple.js</a>.</p>

<p>The first of these is ordered by number of followers, and the second by gender split. The eagle-eyed among you will see that one account from the top 100 is missing from all these charts due to the JSON error I discuss above, thankfully it's a boring one (sorry <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitPic" target="_blank"><a href='https://github.com/TwitPic' class='user-mention'>@TwitPic</a></a>).</p>

<p>Where would your account be on these graphs? Somehow I end up alongside Wayne Rooney in terms of gender diversity :s</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<ul>
<li>A lot of the time genders can't be called from an account's first name. Maybe they haven't given a first name, maybe it's a business account or some pretty unicode symbols, maybe it's a spammy egg account. This means my realised sample size is <<1000, sometimes the majority of usernames had no gender (e.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/UberSoc" target="_blank"><a href='https://github.com/UberSoc' class='user-mention'>@UberSoc</a></a>, fake followers?).
<p><a href="http://benjaminlmoore.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/with_missing.png"><img class="imgright" src="/blog/img/with_missing.png" alt="This (big) chart includes % for those that couldn't be assigned (NA)" width="107" height="150" /></a> This (big) chart includes % for those that couldn't be assigned (NA)</li>
<li>The SSA data is heavily biased towards Western (esp. US) and non-English names are likely to not be assigned a gender throughout. This is a shame, if you know of a more international gender DB please let me know.</li>
<li>I'm sampling most recent followers, so maybe accounts like Justin Bieber have a much higher female ratio in earlier followers than those which have only just hit the follow button.</li>
<li>The sample size of 1000 followers per account is smaller than I'd like, especially for accounts with 50 million followers.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have other ideas of what to do with demographics data, or have noticed additional caveats of this study, please let me know in the comments!</p>
