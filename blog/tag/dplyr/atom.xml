		<description><![CDATA[
		   <p>Living in Edinburgh it&#39;s been hard to avoid the build-up to Scotland&#39;s referendum on independence. On September 18<sup>th</sup> 2014, less than a month away as I write this, people living in Scotland will go to the polls to answer the question: Should Scotland be an independent country?</p>

<p>Over the last couple of years there&#39;s been a good amount of media coverage and &mdash; more interestingly, from my point of view &mdash; repeat polls to gauge opinion by various newspapers and tv stations. This invites an obvious question: how has the mood in Scotland varied over time with respect to a yes/no vote? And can we detect any biases among those publishing polls?</p>

<h2>The data</h2>

<p>Anthony Wells (<a href="https://twitter.com/anthonyjwells"><a href='https://github.com/anthonyjwells' class='user-mention'>@anthonyjwells</a></a>) of YouGov has put together <a href="http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/scottish-independence-referendum">a table</a> of survey results dating back to January 2012. Without too much hassle we can build a messy <code>data.frame</code> from this in R via the <code>XML</code> package:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-r" data-lang="r">polls <span class="o">&lt;-</span> readHTMLTable<span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/scottish-independence-referendum&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> skip.rows<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">)[[</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">]]</span>

</code></pre></div>
<h2>Polls over time</h2>

<p>After a bit of data <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html">&quot;janitor work&quot;</a>, we can visualise the poll trends over time. Given sampling error and other sources of noise (though I think these sample sizes tend to be decent), a loess model can pick out the long-term trends.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/indyref_trends.png" target="_blank">
<img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/indyref_trends_thumb.png" />
</a></p>

<h2>Pollster biases</h2>

<p>If we accept the above models as a reasonable estimate of the expected poll response at a given time, we can analyse the residuals of actual poll results and look for systematic biases. In theory, with a respectable sample size (all have ~1000) and a reasonably well-stratified sampling method, we might expect polls results to be roughly normally distributed around the expected polls result &mdash; regardless of who comissioned or performed the poll.</p>

<p>Here are the distributions per poll publisher or commisioner, note that these are only for those who commisioned more than 1 poll in this dataset, and only those that my regex has been able to pick out.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/indyref_YesBiasNewspapers.png" target="_blank">
<img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/indyref_YesBiasNewspapers_thumb.png" />
</a></p>

<p>The sample sizes here are generally too small to claim they are polling significantly above or below expectation, save for The Sunday Times (significantly more pro-Independence than expected, p = 7 &times; 10<sup>-4</sup>) and <a href="http://www.tns-bmrb.co.uk/home">TNS BMRB</a>, a &quot;think tank&quot; with offices in London and Edinburgh who seem to both perform and publish their own polls (p &lt; 1 &times; 10<sup>-3</sup>).</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/indyref_YesBiasPollsters.png" target="_blank">
<img class="imgright" src="/blog/img/indyref_YesBiasPollsters_tiny.png" />
</a></p>

<p>Caveats here are that different polls have used different question sets, methods etc. so this isn&#39;t evidence for anything underhanded <em>per se</em>. We can look at the same thing per pollster, i.e. it seems reasonable to expect that while newspapers and the SNP might have reasons to publish polls in their favour, people conducting the polls should generally be more or less indifferently.</p>

<p>The results again are hampered by a small number of datapoints per pollster, but  the pollster <a href="https://www.panelbase.net/index.aspx">Panelbase</a> emerges as one providing significantly yes-skewed poll results (p &lt; 6 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup>). Interestingly they may be the only pollster here to have a <a href="https://www.panelbase.net/rewards.aspx">rewards system</a> inplace. The only other significantly non-zero biased results come again from TNS BMRB, who published most of their own polls in the above graph.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>What do the polls say? Well, the majority of Scots have been against independence for the last couple of years (and beyond), however polls appear to have been more variable in recent months and the outcome of the referendum is expected to be close.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/indyref_yesPercent.png" target="_blank">
<img class="imgleft" src="/blog/img/indyref_yesPercent_tiny.png" />
</a></p>

<p>Since we have a (poorly fitting) linear model here we can &mdash; I must stress this is tongue-in-cheek &mdash; extrapolate to referendum day and get a prediction of the referendum result:</p>

<p style="font-size: larger; text-align:center">42.9% Yes</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller; text-align:center;">(99% confidence interval: 40.9 < <i>x</i> < 45.0)</p>

        <title>Are more expensive motorcycle helmets safer?</title>
        <link>http://blm.io/blog/motorcycle-helmet-safety-price</link>

		<description><![CDATA[
		   <p>Apparently an 80s commerical for the helmet manufacturer <a href="http://www.bellhelmets.com/">Bell</a> bore the slogan:
<em>&quot;If you&#39;ve got a $10 head, wear a $10 helmet&quot;</em>. Nowadays it&#39;s a deeply-ingrained
and widely accepted idea among bikers that it&#39;s worth
spending a lot of money on your headgear. A top-of-the-line Arai can sell for
almost four figures, particularly if you want a nice
<a href="http://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/arai-corsair-v-joey-dunlop-2014-le-helmet">race rep</a>
 design, but what are you getting for your money and, in particular, is it
 any safer than a helmet you pickup for a tenth of that price?</p>

<p>There are various minimum safety standards for bike helmets. The US has
<a href="http://www.smf.org/docs/articles/dot">Snell and DOT</a>, whereas the UK
requires the snappily named
<a href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030140499">BS 6658:1985 specification</a>
or the European standard, ECE22.05, <a href="http://www.whitedogbikes.com/whitedogblog/motorbike-helmet-road-legal-uk/">apparently equivalent</a>
to the US DOT. But these are <em>minimum standards</em> that manufacturers must design towards,
as such they don&#39;t help differentiating between ratified helmets.</p>

<h2>SHARP ratings</h2>

<p><img class="imgright" src="/blog/img/sharp_logo.png" /></p>

<p>In the UK, an impartial government safety scheme has been set up with its own forced acronym
(the Safety Helmet Assessment and Rating Programme, <a href="http://sharp.direct.gov.uk/">SHARP</a>)
to try to scientifically assess how protective helmets are in <a href="http://sharp.direct.gov.uk/node/33">simulated crash-like tests</a>,
designed using real-world data. Take a look at this <a href="http://sharp.direct.gov.uk/content/animation">neat animation</a>
for more information.</p>

<p>They condense the data from 32 tests over seven replicates into a simple 5-star rating,
with 5 star helmets <a href="http://sharp.direct.gov.uk/content/ratings">said to provide</a>
&quot;good levels of protection right around the helmet&quot;. As of April 2014, their database
contains a total of 328 helmet models, a decent set of results for some further analysis.</p>

<h2>Price ranges per brand</h2>

<p>A good starting point is to look at the spread of helmet prices, identifying the premium
brands and the cheapies that have been tested by SHARP.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/motorcycle_helmet_brands_pricerange.png" target="_blank">
<img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/motorcycle_helmet_brands_pricerange_thumb.png" />
</a></p>

<p>We can see why Bell might be keen to push the idea that we all need expensive helmets!</p>

<h2>Helmet types</h2>

<p>Helmets in the dataset are spit into two categories: full-face and &quot;system&quot;. As
far as I can tell the latter refer to what I would call &quot;flip-front&quot; helmets.
These have a hinged jaw section which you can raise either to use as an open-face helmet or
more commonly so as to pay for your petrol without scaring the cashier.</p>

<p><img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/motorcycle_helmetkey.png" /></p>

<p>I&#39;m not aware this has been conclusively proven but the general feeling among bikers
seems to be that a flip-front helmet offers less protection than a more rigid full-face.
Does the SHARP data agree?</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/motorcyle_helmet_type.png" target="_blank">
<img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/motorcyle_helmet_type_thumb.png" />
</a></p>

<p>There is a greater proportion of top-rated full-face helmets, and the most
common rating for flip-front lids is 3 stars, compared to 4 for full-face. However
full-face helmets dominate the dataset (86% of helmets tested by SHARP), and most brands
will only produce a couple of flip models, save the specialists like
<a href="http://www.schuberth.com/en/businesssegments/motorcycle.html">Schuberth</a>.</p>

<h2>Cost vs. Protection</h2>

<p>The main question to be answered with this dataset is: are more expensive helmets
more protective, and if so to what degree?</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/motorcycle_helmet_overalltrend.png" target="_blank">
<img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/motorcycle_helmet_overalltrend_thumb.png" />
</a></p>

<p>Overall yes, there&#39;s a non-zero linear regression coefficient that suggests each additional
£ spent on a helmet returns 2 &times; 10<sup>-4</sup> SHARP rating points. It&#39;s
worth noting that this trend explains a measly 6% of the variance in helmet ratings and,
more interestingly, the y-intercept is a fairly decent 3.1 rating, suggesting there are some
cheap but highly rated helmets in the dataset.</p>

<p>We can break this relationship trend down by manufacturer:</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/motorcycle_helmet_brandtrends.png" target="_blank">
<img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/motorcycle_helmet_brandtrends_thumb.png" />
</a></p>

<p>There are some striking differences here. Entry brands like <a href="http://www.nitro-helmets.com/">Nitro</a>
seem good examples of where a higher outlay is likely to result in significantly better
crash protection. The <a href="http://www.whyarai.co.uk/">Arai</a> premium brand, however, has little relationship between
price and protection, with most of their range scoring the same 3 out of 5 rating.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice the points in these graphs have been jittered to prevent them all stacking
at the integer ratings, and give the illusion of a (preferable) continuous rating.
At this point any statisticians reading may criticise the use of linear
regression here (on unjittered values, of course), as the rating system is really an ordinal variable and so would be
better suited to something like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_logit">ordered logit model</a>.
With these caveats in mind I won&#39;t overinterpret the above linear models.</p>

<h2>Best and worsts</h2>

<p>So to finish, two important questions: what are the best/worst value for money helmets,
and which brands overall output the most protective and reasonably priced lids?</p>

<h3>Brand summaries</h3>

<p>Here I&#39;m plotting the mean SHARP rating across each brand&#39;s tested helmets, against
their median helmet price which were then ranked 1 to 22, with 22 being the most
expensive brand on average.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/img/motorcycle_helmet_brandsummary.png" target="_blank">
<img class="imgfull" src="/blog/img/motorcycle_helmet_brandsummary_thumb.png" />
</a></p>

<p>Grey rectangles indicate both the cheapest third of brands,
and the safest third. Much to my surprise, the only brand falling in the intersection
of these two is Marushin, which is a new brand to me but have been
<a href="http://www.visordown.com/product-features/five-safest-motorcycle-helmets-for-under-150/18341-6.html">noted previously</a>
for their highly-rated helmets.</p>

<p>I should quickly point out that protection isn&#39;t the only reason people splash out on
premium helmets; they can be lighter, more comfortable, quieter and look better &mdash;
plus with that Shoei symbol above your visor no-one will take you for a
&quot;<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Squid">squid</a>&quot;. However the old
Bell advertising slogan seems a bit hollow now, as the crafty consumer can protect their
priceless head with a 5-star rated helmet for as little as 60 GBP (100 USD).</p>
